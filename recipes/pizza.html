    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a well known Italian dish and is eaten all over the world. Everyone's recipe differs from another's and there are many recipes for many different kinds of pizza</p>
    <p>This will be my take on the salami pizza, which is one of the most popular variation of this street food.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For this recipe you will need these ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough(homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce of your preference</li>
        <li>Cheese(also of your preference)</li>
        <li>Salami sausage</li>
        <li>Oregano and basil(for garnishing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough in your prefered size onto a table</li>
        <li>Take the tomato sauce and spread it across the dough with circular motions with a spoon leaving an approximately 1cm wide area on the outside of the dough uncovered</li>
        <li>Grate some cheese(and by some I mean enough for covering the sauce area twice)</li>
        <li>Scatter the cheese across the sauce-covered area almost fully covering the sauce</li>
        <li>Slice up the salami in thin, round slices</li>
        <li>Put as much salami on the cheese as you wish</li>
        <li>Scatter some more cheese on top of the salami</li>
        <li>Scatter a little bit of oregano on the pizza</li>
        <li>Heat up the oven to about 185 degrees Celsius and once it's hot, put the pizza in the oven</li>
        <li>Bake it until the dough on the side is golden brown and take it out of the oven</li>
        <li>Garnish it with some basil</li>
        <li>Cut the pizza in 8 slices</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The pizza is ready to eat. Bon appetit!</p>
